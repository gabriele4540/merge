# AI Coding Agent Instructions for Merge

## Project Overview

**Status:** Early-stage project with minimal structure (README.md only)

This is a placeholder project. No complex architecture or workflows have been established yet. Future development should define:
- Primary purpose and scope
- Technology stack and framework choices
- Development environment setup

## Current Structure

- `README.md` - Project description

## Getting Started for AI Agents

When contributing to this project:

1. **Clarify scope** - Ask the user to specify what they're building before making architectural decisions
2. **Establish conventions early** - Document chosen patterns in this file as they emerge
3. **Create modular structure** - Plan for separate concerns (config, src, tests, docs) from the start

## Next Steps to Enhance These Instructions

Update this file with the following as the project develops:

- [ ] **Architecture** - Document major components and their relationships
- [ ] **Build & Test** - Add commands for building, testing, and local development
- [ ] **Coding Patterns** - Define naming conventions, file organization, and common patterns
- [ ] **Dependencies** - List critical external libraries and their purpose
- [ ] **Deployment** - Document how code is deployed or released
